            <h2>About Me</h2>
          
            <p>
                I am an aspiring software developer with a growing foundation in JavaScript, React, Prisma, and SQL. I hold an MBA with a focus in Operations Management from the University of Saint Francis and a Web Development certificate from The University of Illinois Chicago & Fullstack Academy.
            </p>
            <p>
                Beyond my technical pursuits, I bring nearly 8 years of experience in the insurance industry—covering contracting, commissions, application management, client relationships, and more—while currently serving as a Senior Benefits Specialist. My career has allowed me to collaborate with key roles on both the broker and carrier sides of the Life and Disability industry, offering me the privilege of supporting individuals through some of life’s most challenging moments.
            </p>
            <p>
                With a passion for helping others and optimizing processes, I am committed to enhancing user experiences and improving organizational efficiency. Transitioning to technology felt like a natural extension of my mission to make a meaningful impact. My goal is to combine my business expertise with my technical skill set to drive operational efficiency, improve user experiences, and continue my journey of lifelong learning.
